Fullstack Engineer who builds web products from scratch to scale.

5+ years of experience in startups & scale-ups â€” from first prototype to production systems that scale.

My journey: I've contributed to products in recruitment (HireSweet), sales (Topo), and legal tech (Doctrine). What drives me? Turning complex problems into elegant solutions.

Stack: TypeScript on both sides â€” React/Next.js on the frontend, Node.js/Nest.js on the backend. SQL & NoSQL databases. Docker, CI/CD, automated testing.

My approach: Clean code, architecture built to last, continuous improvement. I love building from scratch and laying solid technical foundations â€” while keeping the ability to iterate fast.

What motivates me: Impact. Seeing a product evolve, solving real problems, and the team growing around it. I'm looking for ambitious projects with teams who want to build something they're proud of.

Master's degree in Software Engineering. Always learning â€” certified in JS expert, data structures, algorithmic complexity.
